# GUI Madness: An Exploration into the World of Graphical UI
This is an exploration into the GUI making capabilities of multiple languages. Here we will compare Python, Java, C++, C#, and even the Electron framework. Strap in!

## A Quick Note/Methodology ##
I am going to layout some basic ground rules and the methodology behind how each language will be compared. I don't intend on really judging each language or assigning a score/ranking beyond my personal thoughts or preference. My goal is primarily to educate myself more on the capability of each language, and to serve as a resource for anyone who happens to stumble on this repo. With that being said, let me breakdown how this will work.

With each language, I am going to pick the top packages/modules used for making a desktop app. With each of these packages, and their respective languages, we are going to examine a variety of areas. 

 First, we are going to see how much it takes to create a simple "Hello World" window with a menu bar at the top that cascades down with more options. This will serve as a baseline for how quickly you can get off the ground using that language/package combination. Once the window is completed, we are going to look at the quantity and complexity of the code that was needed to construct it. We are also going to comment on the aesthetics.
 
 After we have finished making a window for each language/package combination, we'll move onto to making two different kinds of applications. The first will be a simple desktop calculator and the second will be a password manager. We'll follow the same procedure as before and examine the quantity/complexity of the program we wrote along with the overall look of it.
 
 ## The Rules ##
 We are going to lay down some ground rules just to make sure one language doesn't have an advantage over the other. For each language, we'll use the language plus the package we're using and any other common packages used to make things simpler. At the beginning, we won't use things like CSS or other styling/mark-up. We'll do this just to compare the basic look of what each language can create.
 
 ## The Languages & Packages ##
 Python: PyQT, Tkinter, wxPython, PySimpleGUI
 Java: JavaFX, Swing, AWT, QtJambi
 C++: Qt, wxWidgets, JUCE, CEF
 C#: WPF, WinForms
 
 ### Special Addition: Electron.js Framework ###
 Okay so, I know Electron isn't a language but rather a framework that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With that being said, some of the biggest apps today are built using in like: WhatsApp, Visual Studio Code, Twitch, Microsoft Teams, and thousands more. Because of this, I felt like it would be a mistake to leave it off even if it isn't a language.
